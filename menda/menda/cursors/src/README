Building the Bridge Icon set from the Inkscape SVG:

1. Open raw.svg in Inkscape.
2. Go Extensions → Web → Slicer → Export layout pieces and css code
3. Enter the folder location you want the PNG files exported to. The file you
    should export to is raw/. Copy and paste from a file manager for an easy
    time with this. Uncheck any checked options. Hit Apply.
4. In the raw folder, locate _build.sh and run it. It will send finished cursor
    files to /raw/output.
5. Take the cursors send to /raw/output and copy them to bridge/cursors.

No trimming will have been done to the final cursors, and X11 might give you
split-second glitches when switching cursors, making them appear to jump to the
side for an instant. To remedy this, you will need to open any auto-generated in
gimp and re-export when with the “trim whitespace” option checked.

You will need the “X11 Mouse Cursor (XMC)” plugin for GIMP installed.
